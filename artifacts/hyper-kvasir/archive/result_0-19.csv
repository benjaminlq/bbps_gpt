This is because a portion of the mucosa of the colon segment is seen, but other areas are not well seen due to the presence of residual stool that appears to be substantial. The mucosa is not completely obscured, which would warrant a score of 0, but the cleanliness is not at the level of a score of 2 or 3, where minor residual staining or a clear view of the entire mucosa would be observed, respectively.",1
