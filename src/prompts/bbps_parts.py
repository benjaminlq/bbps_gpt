GRADING CRITERIA: Use the following BBPS Grading Criteria to determine the Grade of the given bowel image.
Grade 0: Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared
Grade 1: Portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid
Grade 2: Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well
Grade 3: Entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid. The wording of the scale was finalized after incorporating feedback from three colleagues experienced in colonoscopy.
